## APL Accuracy Testing

A folder filled with a lot of information on testing the accuracy and consistency between using APL and NL (Natural Language).

For now, it's filled with nothing as I am devising a way of efficiently and accurately testing, as prompt complexity can severely decrease consistency (such as tracefusion).

Plan:

- Get generated data
- Create pool of collected data
- Go over it and analyse.

rough plan however I plan to use the same kind of idea as the "complexity" value in encoding since it's mostly unbiased.
