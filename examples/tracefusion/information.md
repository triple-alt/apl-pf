Hey!

This is a prompt I often used to test encoding and decoding. If you are curious "v1" failed to encode any prompt I gave it, which is why it's missing. "v2" has the least characters but is by far the least usable and for now "v4" stands to be the best of both worlds. **You can also find the prompt I used for each test, constantly the same prompt.**
